            <h2>How to Protect & Care for Horses</h2>
            <p>Protection starts with good care. A horse needs five key things to be safe and healthy.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>1. Proper Food & Water</h3>
                <p>Horses are grazing animals. They need a constant supply of fresh, clean water and high-quality food, mostly hay or grass (forage).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>2. Safe Shelter</h3>
                <p>A horse needs a shelter to escape from hot sun, rain, wind, and insects. This can be a stable or even just a three-sided shed in their field.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>3. Health & Vet Care</h3>
                <p>Horses need regular care from a veterinarian for vaccinations and a farrier (hoof specialist) to trim their hooves every 6-8 weeks, like a human cutting their fingernails.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>4. Exercise & Company</h3>
                <p>Horses are social herd animals and should not be kept alone. They also need space to move around and exercise every day to stay physically and mentally healthy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>5. Breed Conservation</h3>
                <p>Another way to "protect" horses is to support organizations that work to save endangered breeds. Some breeds, like the Suffolk Punch draft horse, are critically endangered.</p>
